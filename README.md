Hello, this is one of my first personal projects.

In this Java application you can create and manage activities setting: the name, the description, the beginning date, the expected end date, the official end date and the priority. For every completed activity the amount of hours will be automatically calculated .
You can mark "ended" an activity directly from the table view.

You can select the view with all activities or with only the active ones.

You can export all the activities in an xlsx file: when you export the active activities the export file will be overrided, when you export all the file will be updated and the new activities will ber added to your file, so your can add an excel graph to have additional statistics about your activities.

You can run the program by running MainApplication in the app package, make sure you edit the application.properties file to configure your database and where would you like to have your xlsx file exported in.


If I will have time (and motivation) to improve this project I will add users management with a login interface so multiple users can use the app and add new activities assigning them to someone. (I don't do it right now because I'm not skilled enough LOL)
I will also build the project as a jar file (for now it's not necessary because it was a learning project and is not intended for production use)

No one will probably read this, but if you are a senior developer kind and magnanimous enough to give me suggestions I would be glad about that

Bye bye
